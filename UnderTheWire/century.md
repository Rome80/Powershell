# Century

## Level 1

The password for Century2 is the build version of the instance of PowerShell installed on this system.

## Note
– The format is as follows: **.*.*****.**** <br>
– Include all periods <br>
– Be sure to look for build version and NOT PowerShell version <br>

To check the powershell version we can use the command $PSVersionTable, which is a read-only hash table that returns information about the Powershell version.
